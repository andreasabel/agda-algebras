# agda-algebras

This is a copy of the Agda Universal Algebra Library which depends the [Standard Library](https://github.com/agd
a/agda-stdlib) of the [Agda](https://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php) proof assistant language.
It is currently under active reconstruction, and should be regarded as alpha software.  (The previous version of the Agda Universal Algebra Library, which was called UALib, was based on the [Type Topology](https://github.com/martinescardo/TypeTopology) library of [Martín Escardó][].)

---------------------------

## Introduction

This repository contains the source code, as well as the files used to generate 
the [documentation](https://ualib.guthub.io/agda-algebras), for (this version of) the 
[Agda Universal Algebra Library](https://github.com/ualib/agda-algebras).  (Documentation for the previous version is available at [ualib.org](https://ualib.gitlab.io).)

-----------------------------

## Documentation

Agda was used to generate html pages for each module. These pages are now served at

[https://ualib.org](https://ualib.org)

(The previous version of the agda-algebras library, called UALib, is documented at [ualib.org](https://ualib.gitlab.io).)

1.  **Html generation**  
    Here is how the html pages are generated.
    a.  Its best to start with the `generate-html` branch of the repository, to ensure that the text surrounding Agda code in all .lagda files are written in markdown (as opposed to tex).
        ```
        git checkout generate-html
        ```
    b.  Edit the literate Agda files, e.g., `src/Demos/HSP.lagda`, as needed.  The text surrounding the code should be written in markdown.
    c.  Invoke the `generate-html` script from the main `agda-algebras` directory.  Assuming everything type-checks, this will generate html documentation files in the `html` directory.

2.  **Html website**  
    GitHub uses the content residing in the `gh-pages` branch of the repository when serving the documentation web pages, so that's where we want to push the new html pages we generated in Step 1 above.
    a.  After completing Step 1, checkout the `gh-pages` branch.
        ```
        git checkout gh-pages
        ```
    b.  Copy all of the new documentation files into the main `agda-algebras` directory.
        ```
        \cp html/* .
        ```
    c.  Stage, commit, and push.
        ```
        git add .
        git commit -m "update html documentation pages"
        git push remote gh-pages
        ```
    Finally, visit to the [gh-pages](https://github.com/ualib/agda-algebras/tree/gh-pages) page at GitHub to check that the new files were deployed correctly.  (There should be a green check mark next to the latest commit number; if there's a bronze circle, click on it to monitor the deployment job progress.)

## Install Agda

Agda ([version 2.6.1](https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/v2.6.1/getting-started/installation.html) or greater) is required. 

If you don't have it, follow the [official Agda installation instructions](https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/v2.6.0/getting-started/installation.html).


For reference, the following is a list of commands that should correctly install Agda version 2.6.2 on a Ubuntu 18.04 machine. Please submit an issue or pull request if these commands don't work for you.

```
cabal update
git clone git@github.com:agda/agda.git
cd agda
git checkout release-2.6.2
cabal install Agda-2.6.2 --program-suffix=-2.6.2  # (takes a very long time)
cd ~/.cabal/bin/
touch ~/.emacs
cp ~/.emacs ~/.emacs.backup
./agda-mode-2.6.2 setup
./agda-mode-2.6.2 compile
mkdir -p ~/bin
cp ~/.emacs ~/bin
cp ~/.emacs.backup ~/.emacs
cd ~/bin
echo '#!/bin/bash' > agdamacs
echo 'PATH=~/.cabal/bin:$PATH emacs --no-init-file --load ~/bin/.emacs $@' >> agdamacs
chmod +x agdamacs
echo 'export PATH=~/bin:~/.cabal/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.profile
```

Now invoking the command `agdamacs` will launch emacs with Agda 2.6.2 and agda-mode installed.)
